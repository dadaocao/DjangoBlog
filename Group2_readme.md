2.The website also has a translator app
 2.1 translate text from one language to another 2.2 choose the target language you want
 2.3 page landscaping

3.We also build a interface to show you our learning results of data science, data visualization, and machine learning.

3.1 Analyse the number of films released each year, calculate each movie type's proportion. Visualise the conclusion.

3.2 Analyse the movie comments' emotional tendency based on NLTK and VADER.
 3.3 Using audience count and movie runtime to predict the audience status (spilled or upright).
